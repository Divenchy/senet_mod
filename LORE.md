Hast mercy! 

The ruthless emperor hath unleashed his wrath upon the religious sects of Osiris and Apopis. The peasants must now trek a journey through Duat
thy groveling at the chance for the Afterlife. Disciples of Osiris and Acolytes of Apopis clash in front of the Gate of the Afterlife. Desperate 
and exasperated from their journey through Duat, the sects find themselves distressed enough willing to rob the opposing sects chance to the Afterlife.
